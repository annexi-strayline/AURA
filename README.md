# AURA Reference Implementation (AURA CLI)

This is the Reference Implementation of The Ada User Repository Annex (AURA) integrated package management and build system for Ada.

Please refer to the [Official AURA docs](https://aura-docs.readthedocs.io/) for build instructions and details about what AURA is and how you can use it.

Please see our public launch [blog post](https://annexi-strayline.com/blog/posts/4) for some discussion on our philisophical approach that lead to the design of AURA, where it got its name, and what the ultimate ambitions are.

Also check out our companion AURA curated coalesced repository [ASAP](https://github.com/annexi-strayline/ASAP), which contains BSD-licensed open source AURA subsystems for any use.
